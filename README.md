# appium-interceptor-plugin

This is an Appium plugin designed to intercept API response and mocking easy.
This plugin uses mitmproxy

## Prerequisite

1. Appium version 2.0
2. Intercepting API requests from android requires CA certificate to be installed on the device. Follow the instructions in [How to install CA certificate on android](./docs/certificate-installation.md) section and install the CA certificate.

## Installation - Server

Install the plugin using Appium's plugin CLI, either as a named plugin or via NPM:

```shell
appium plugin install --source=npm appium-interceptor-plugin
```

## Activation

The plugin will not be active unless turned on when invoking the Appium server:

`appium server -ka 800 --use-plugins=appium-interceptor -pa /wd/hub`

## what does this plugin do?

For every appium session, interceptor plugin will start a proxy server and updates the device proxy settings to pass all network traffic to proxy server. Mocking is disabled by default and can be enabled from the test by passing `appium:intercept : true` in the desired capability while creating a new appium session.

Please refer to the [commands](/docs/commands.md) sections for detailed usage.
